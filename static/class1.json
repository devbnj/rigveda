    [{"tip": "Introduction","body": "This course provides a peek into the Veda archives. More than a peep, it is an initiation. Especially Rig Veda. It also bridges the gap between what may have been said many thousands of years back to how we can interpret them correctly. There have been several attempts in the past to understand Rig Veda. Many authors studying Indic civilizations interpreted the texts through their discourse with Sanskrit Pundits. Had they not begun, it would have been an uphill task trying it now. But, Rig Veda predates Sanskrit as we know it today, and the translators were caught up in its ritualistic practices prevalent in nineteenth century and hastily wrote what they were told by the Raj-serving authors."}]}
