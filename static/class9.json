    {"tip": "Description", "body": "The means to get Agni is through spiritual practice which is rooted in meditation;  meditation that works under all conditions, whether in light or in dark. There is no ritual or rite mentioned, indicating the esoteric nature of the yajna. The adoration of Agni and the constant meditation on him, while engaged in all activities, is the definitive sign of contact with Agni. *dhiya*: plural of dhi, meaning thought, understanding or intelligence. This corresponds to the later word *buddhi*. It is given a variety of meanings like, *water, work, sacrifice, food, and thought* by Sayanacharya. But its natural interpretation given here fits in all the verses of Veda where it occurs. *nama*: obeisance or a spirit of self-surrender. It is not a physical act, but a thought. Sayanacharya mostly translates as *food*. It occurs more than 250 times in the Rig Veda. *upa + emasi*: we approach."}
