    {"tip": "Description", "body": "*rayim*: means inner plenitude or felicity. Only an inner treasure can have a descriptor *increases everyday*. *yashas* (glory) is an adjective to the treasure. The inner treasure is endowed with a force so powerful that it enables the human to overcome the obstacles, caused by adverse powers that prevent the enjoyment of bliss. The aspirant obtains this treasure by the grace of Agni who summons other Gods and makes way for the manifestation of their powers in man. *vira*: the hero-power which battles the assaults of ignorance and falsehood. Sayanacharya translates it as a son. *yashasam*: conquering glory. It is derived from root word – yash, to strive. Sayanacharya translates it as, *fame from charities*."}
